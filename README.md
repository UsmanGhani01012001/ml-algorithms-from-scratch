Perceptron Algorithm: From Scratch Implementation & VisualizationThis repository showcases a fundamental machine learning algorithm, the Perceptron, implemented entirely from scratch in Python. The project demonstrates the core mechanics of this classic binary classification model, including data generation, training, and visualization of its decision boundary.This project is an excellent example of understanding algorithm internals, a crucial skill for machine learning engineers and data scientists.FeaturesSynthetic Data Generation: Utilizes sklearn.datasets.make_classification to create a separable 2D dataset for binary classification, ideal for demonstrating the Perceptron's capabilities.Perceptron Algorithm Implementation (From Scratch): Contains a custom Python function (perceptron) that implements the Perceptron learning rule, including handling of bias (intercept) and weight updates.Step Activation Function: Implements the classic step activation function integral to the Perceptron.Decision Boundary Visualization: Uses matplotlib to plot the generated data points and the learned linear decision boundary, providing clear insights into how the Perceptron separates classes.Algorithm Overview: The PerceptronThe Perceptron is one of the simplest artificial neural networks, introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. It's a binary linear classifier that learns a decision boundary by iteratively adjusting its weights based on misclassified samples. While simple, it forms the basis for understanding more complex neural network architectures.Learning RuleThe Perceptron updates its weights w and bias b using the following rule for each misclassified sample (x,y):w_{new} = w_{old} + \text{learning_rate} \times (y - \hat{y}) \times xb_{new} = b_{old} + \text{learning_rate} \times (y - \hat{y})Where:y is the true label.y^​ is the predicted label.\text{learning_rate} controls the step size of weight updates.The step function for binary classification is defined as:y^​=1 if w⋅x+b>0 else 0Project StructureThe entire project is self-contained within a single Python script or Jupyter Notebook.perceptron_implementation.py (or perceptron_implementation.ipynb): The main script/notebook containing all the code for data generation, Perceptron implementation, training, and visualization.requirements.txt: Lists all necessary Python dependencies.README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.SetupClone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
